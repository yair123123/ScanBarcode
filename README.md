# ScanBarcode

ScanBarcode is a React Native mobile application built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/). It allows you to scan barcodes using the device camera or from images stored on the device. Scanned barcodes can be saved, displayed and marked as used.

## Features

- Scan barcodes directly from the camera
- Import images and scan barcodes from the gallery
- Manual barcode entry when scanning isn't possible
- Manage a list of scanned barcodes and mark them as inactive
- Simple slider interface to display saved barcodes

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   Use the on-screen options to run the app on an Android emulator, iOS simulator or a physical device with Expo Go.

### Additional Scripts

- `npm test` &mdash; run the Jest test suite
- `npm run lint` &mdash; check the project with Expo's linter
- `npm run reset-project` &mdash; create a clean `app` directory from the template
